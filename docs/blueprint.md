- Background color: A very light, desaturated tint of teal (#F0F8F8) to keep the content easily readable and the page accessible.
- Accent color: A warm orange (#D9883D), an analogous hue that contrasts nicely with the teal for call-to-action buttons.
- Font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font offering a clean and modern look, suitable for both headlines and body text, and which aligns with the engineering field. 
- Employ a clean, grid-based layout for clear content presentation.
- Use minimalist icons to represent skills, technologies, and interests.
- Incorporate subtle animations on scroll and hover interactions to provide engaging feedback without distracting from the content.
